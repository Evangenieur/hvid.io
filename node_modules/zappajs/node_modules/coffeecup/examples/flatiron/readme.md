# FlatIron Example

In this folder there are three flatiron examples:

* Single File
* Views only app
* MVC Style

The single file, is full web app in one file style, for simple one page
apps.

The views only app is more like a sinatra crud application.

The mvc style application demos how you might want to implement a larger
flatiron application.

All of these samples take advantage of a flatiron plugin for coffeecup
called creamer.
